Accurate brain tumor classification is crucial fo In this study, a transfer learning-based approach was employed to fine-tune several pre-trained CNN models for a three-class classification problem: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors, using the publicly available Brain Tumor Classification MRI dataset. Models like VGG16, VGG19, EfficientNet (B0-B4), DenseNet121, Xception, ResNet-152, and MobileNetV2 were fine-tuned with ImageNet weights and tailored for tumor classification. The hybrid model combining EfficientNetB0 and VGG16 achieved the highest accuracy of 98.3%. Data augmentation further improved model robustness. Additionally, Grad-CAM was used to visualize the regions of MRI images most relevant to the classification decision. The ensemble model demonstrated excellent performance with an accuracy of 98.32%, precision of 98.73%, recall of 98.13%, and an F1-score of 98.79%.
